# Workshop - Autocorrect

In this workshop, you will be writing higher order functions to implement a basic autocorrect algorithm. The key concepts behind this algorithm are _relevance_ and _distance_. Given a string to correct, we first choose _relevant_ strings from a larger set, and then of that subset, we select the _closest_ option.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Add your cohort team so your code can be reviewed.
3. Complete the functions marked with `TODO` in `autocorrect.js`.

## Hints

- The functions are intended to be completed in the order they appear.
- Instead of writing a new function, can you use one you've already written?
- What edge cases are not covered in the included test cases?

## Extensions

If you are done early, consider the following extensions:

- Use `jest` to write tests for the functions in `autocorrect.js`.
- Research other metrics of distance and try to implement some!

## Submission

Please submit a link to your Github repository.
